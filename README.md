# TimeClock
This app keeps track of clock-in, clock-out, and work performed. </br>
I created it for myself because we needed to log everything we did including the time. </br>
Being the creative software engineer I am, I wanted to help automate that process.</br>
So I wrote this quick app using Node, Express, MongoDb, and HTML/CSS.
